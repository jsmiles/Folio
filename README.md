My active developer portfolio website, please visit the deployed site [here](https://jtsdev.tech/)

## Description
This site is the showcase for my developer technical portfolio. The initial site was written in Gatsby using a template but I found it clunky to update and was not fully satisfied with the design. My goal with this site was to build a clean, simple and functional site that in the first instance showcases my main portfolio projects. However, I also took the opportunity to highlight some of my design inspiration. 

## Lessons Learned
I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite2.html) to build the base app. The standard [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) approach in my experience is much slower and that efficiency is welcome. However, the main learning was how to properly use [Material UI](https://mui.com/). It is truly an amazing component library. I had a clear vision for how I wanted to structure my site and it was made significantly easier with MUI. I really enjoyed the development process and will likely continue using MUI heavily moving forward.
